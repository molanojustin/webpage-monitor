Set `.env` variables. The following are required:
1. PUSHOVER_TOKEN: str - An app specific token generated by Pushover.
2. PUSHOVER_USER: str - A user specific key generated by Pushover.
3. SOURCE_URL: str - The url the program should monitor
4. CHECK_INTERVAL: int - The number of seconds between each check

Once the variables are set, run `monitor.py` and the program will run until a website change is detected.
